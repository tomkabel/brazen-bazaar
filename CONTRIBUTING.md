# Contributing to Kilo Marketplace

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Kilo Marketplace! This guide will help you add new skills that benefit the entire community.

## Before You Start

- Ensure your skill is based on a **real use case**, not a hypothetical scenario.
- Search existing skills to avoid duplicates.
- If possible, attribute the use case to the original person or source.

## Skill Requirements

All skills must:

1. **Solve a real problem** - Based on actual usage, not theoretical applications.
2. **Be well-documented** - Include clear instructions, examples, and use cases.
3. **Be accessible** - Written for non-technical users when possible.
4. **Include examples** - Show practical, real-world usage.
5. **Be tested** - Verify the skill works in Kilo Code
6. **Be safe** - Confirm before destructive operations.

## Skill Structure

Create a new folder with your skill name (use lowercase and hyphens):

```
skills/
└──skill-name/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## SKILL.md Template

Use this template for your skill:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-sentence description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---

# Skill Name

Detailed description of the skill and what it helps users accomplish.

## Skills Must Be Hosted Externally

The Kilo Marketplace does **not** host the source code for contributed skills directly. Instead, the marketplace acts as an index that references skills hosted in external repositories. This design allows skill authors to:

- **Maintain ownership** — you control your skill's repository and can update it at any time
- **Iterate independently** — push fixes and improvements without waiting for marketplace PRs
- **Keep licensing clear** — your repository is the canonical source with its own license

### How It Works

1. **Create a public GitHub repository** for your skill (or a repository containing multiple skills).
2. **Add a `SKILL.md`** file with the standard frontmatter (`name`, `description`, etc.).
3. **Submit a PR to this marketplace** that adds your skill using the `add-remote-skill` tooling (see below). The script automatically pulls in your skill and adds the `metadata.source` reference to the frontmatter.

The marketplace periodically syncs with source repositories to pull in updates, so you don't need to submit a new PR every time you change your skill.

### The `metadata.source` Frontmatter

Every contributed skill in the marketplace must have a `metadata.source` section in its YAML frontmatter. This tells the marketplace where the canonical source lives. **You don't need to add this yourself** — the `add-remote-skill` script (see below) adds it automatically when importing your skill. But for reference, here's what it looks like:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: >-
  A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
metadata:
  category: development
  author: your-github-username
  source:
    repository: https://github.com/yourname/your-skill-repo
    path: path/to/skill
    license_path: LICENSE
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `metadata.source.repository` | **Yes** (for contributed skills) | URL to the GitHub repository containing your skill |
| `metadata.source.path` | **Yes** (for contributed skills) | Path within the repository to the skill directory |
| `metadata.source.ref` | No | Git ref to fetch when the skill is not on the source repository's default branch |
| `metadata.source.license_path` | **Yes** (for contributed skills) | Path to the LICENSE file in the source repo |

### Real-World Examples

Here are some existing skills in the marketplace and how they reference their source repositories:

**Angular Component** (from [analogjs/angular-skills](https://github.com/analogjs/angular-skills)):
```yaml
---
name: angular-component
description: Create modern Angular standalone components following v20+ best practices...
metadata:
  category: development
  source:
    repository: 'https://github.com/analogjs/angular-skills'
    path: skills/angular-component
    license_path: LICENSE
---
```

**Frontend Design** (from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)):
```yaml
---
name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces...
metadata:
  category: development
  source:
    repository: 'https://github.com/anthropics/skills'
    path: skills/frontend-design
    license_path: skills/frontend-design/LICENSE.txt
---
```

**Create Pull Request** (from [cline/cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)):
```yaml
---
name: create-pull-request
description: Create a GitHub pull request following project conventions...
metadata:
  category: development
  source:
    repository: 'https://github.com/cline/cline'
    path: .cline/skills/create-pull-request
---
```

### Adding Your Skill to the Marketplace

Once your skill is hosted in its own repository, use the `add-remote-skill` script to add it:

```bash
npx tsx bin/add-remote-skill.ts https://github.com/yourname/your-repo/tree/main/path/to/skill
```

This script will:
1. Clone only the skill directory from your repository
2. Copy it into `skills/<skill-name>/`
3. Update the SKILL.md frontmatter with the correct `metadata.source` fields

Then submit a PR with the result.

> **Note:** Skills submitted without a valid `metadata.source` referencing an external repository will not be accepted unless they are official Kilo skills.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b add-skill-name`
3. Host your skill in your own public GitHub repository (see above)
4. Run `npx tsx bin/add-remote-skill.ts <github-url-to-your-skill>` to add it
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add [Skill Name] skill"`
6. Push to your fork: `git push origin add-skill-name`
7. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Guidelines

Your PR should:

- **Title**: "Add [Skill Name] skill"
- **Description**: Explain the real-world use case and include:
  - What problem it solves
  - Who uses this workflow
  - Attribution/inspiration source
  - Example of how it's used

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Credit original sources and inspirations
- Focus on practical, helpful skills
- Write clear, accessible documentation
- Test your skills before submitting

## Questions?

Open an issue if you have questions about contributing or need help structuring your skill.

## Attribution

When adding a skill based on someone's workflow or use case, include proper attribution:

```markdown
**Inspired by:** [Person Name]'s workflow
```

or

```markdown
**Credit:** Based on [Company/Team]'s process
```

Examples:

- **Inspired by:** Dan Shipper's meeting analysis workflow
- **Inspired by:** Teresa Torres's content research process
- **Credit:** Based on Notion's documentation workflow

## Contributing Custom Modes

Custom modes allow you to tailor Kilo Code's behavior for specific tasks or workflows. You can contribute modes that benefit the community.

### Mode Requirements
